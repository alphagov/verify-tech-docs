# Handle failure scenarios

After [setting up the successful verification journey][successful-verification], you should make sure your service can handle the failure scenarios.

There are two scenarios when the user does not successfully complete the verification journey:

| Scenario                 | Description |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| `NO_AUTHENTICATION`      | The user chose to cancel at some point in their journey.           |
| `AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE` | The identity provider could not verify the user's identity.          |

Find out how to handle these   failure scenarios, including how to:

- recognise failure responses
- respond to users whose identity was not verified

This guide uses the GOV.UK Verify testing service as a placeholder for the GOV.UK Verify Hub. The testing service is hosted by the GOV.UK Verify team, which means you can follow the instructions on this page using your local VSP setup.

## Prerequisites

To follow instructions on this page, you should have already:

- downloaded [the latest VSP release][vsp-release]
- familiarised yourself with or implemented [the successful verification scenario][successful-verification]

This guide continues from the 'Response from the testing service' section.

## NO_AUTHENTICATION scenario

If a user cancels before the identity verification process is complete, GOV.UK Verify Hub sends a `NO_AUTHENTICATION` response. To run this scenario using the testing service:

1. Submit [an authentication request to the testing service][send-request].
2. Go to the `responseGeneratorLocation` URL in the [response from the testing service][scenario-list].
3. Select the `executeUri` for the `NO_AUTHENTICATION` scenario.

For example, the `NO_AUTHENTICATION` JSON object is similar to:

```json
{
  "executeUri" : "https://compliance-tool-reference.ida.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk:443/rp-test/_6817b389-4924-479c-9851-db089c4e639c/test-non-matching/10",
  "id" : 12,
  "title" : "NO_AUTHENTICATION",
  "description" : "The user chose to cancel at some point in their journey."
},
```

The `responseGeneratorLocation` and `executeUri` are only valid for the VSP session that generated them. The VSP generates a new set of keys for the testing service every time you start it with the development command, which leads to the URLs changing.

If the `responseGeneratorLocation` or `executeUri` you generated don't work, try restarting your VSP. The GOV.UK Verify team periodically restarts the testing service, so restarting your VSP will restore the connection.


### Receive the SAML response from the testing service

Visiting the `executeUri` for the `NO_AUTHENTICATION` scenario causes the testing service to generate a SAML response for this scenario.

The testing service sends the SAML response inside an HTML form, via the browser. The SAML response will be base64 encoded within the `SAMLResponse` form parameter:

```
...
SAMLResponse=PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiPz4KPHNhbWwycDpSZXNwb25zZSBEZXN0aW5hdGlvbj0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYXNzcG9ydC12ZXJpZnktc3R1Yi1yZWx5aW5nLXBhcnR5LWRldi5jbG91ZGFwcHMuZGlnaXRhbC92ZXJpZnkv...
...
```

Your service will receive the form at the endpoint you provided when starting the VSP.

### Request to translate the SAML response

To translate the SAML response into JSON, your service should make an HTTP POST request to the VSP's `/translate-response` endpoint:

```http
> POST /translate-response HTTP/1.1
> Content-Type: application/json
>
{
  "samlResponse" : "PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiPz48c2FtbDJwOkF1dGhuUmVxdWVzdCB4bWxuczpzYW1sMnA9InVybjpvYXNpczpuYW1lczp0YzpTQU1MOjIuMDpwcm90b2NvbCIgRGVzdGluYXRpb249Imh0dHBzOi8vY29tc...",
  "requestId" : "_64c90b35-154f-4e9f-a75b-3a58a6c55e8b",
  "levelOfAssurance" : "LEVEL_2"
}
```

The fields in the request body are:

| Field          | Description                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `samlResponse`     | Base64 encoded SAML response from the testing service                  |
| `requestId`        | The string your saved when generating the authentication request |
| `levelOfAssurance` | The [level of assurance][loa] for your service |

All fields are mandatory.

### Handle the translated response from the VSP

An `HTTP 200 OK` response confirms the VSP translated the SAML response successfully. The response body contains:

```http
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Content-Type: application/json
>
{
    "scenario": "NO_AUTHENTICATION"
}
```

When the translated SAML response contains the `NO_AUTHENTICATION` scenario, your service should redirect the user to a page offering them other ways to use your service. This could be another way of proving their identity online or going somewhere in person to finish the process.

## AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE scenario

If the identity provider cannot verify the user's identity, GOV.UK Verify Hub sends an `AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE` response. To run this scenario using the testing service:

1. Submit [an authentication request to the testing service][send-request].
2. Go to the `responseGeneratorLocation` URL in the [response from the testing service][scenario-list].
3. Select the `executeUri` for the `AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE` scenario.

For example, the `AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE` JSON object is similar to:

```json
{
  "executeUri" : "https://compliance-tool-reference.ida.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk:443/rp-test/_6817b389-4924-479c-9851-db089c4e639c/test-non-matching/10",
  "id" : 14,
  "title" : "AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE",
  "description" : "The identity provider could not verify the user's identity."
},
```

The `responseGeneratorLocation` and `executeUri` are only valid for the VSP session that generated them. The VSP generates a new set of keys for the testing service every time you start it with the development command, which leads to the URLs changing.

If the `responseGeneratorLocation` or `executeUri` you generated don't work, try restarting your VSP. The GOV.UK Verify team periodically restarts the testing service, so restarting your VSP will restore the connection.

Visiting the `executeUri` for the `AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE` scenario causes the testing service to generate a SAML response for this scenario.

```
Your service will receive the form at the endpoint you provided when starting the VSP.

  "requestId" : "_64c90b35-154f-4e9f-a75b-3a58a6c55e8b",
  "levelOfAssurance" : "LEVEL_2"
}
```

The fields in the request body are:

| Field          | Description                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `samlResponse`     | Base64 encoded SAML response from the testing service                  |
| `requestId`        | The string your saved when generating the authentication request |
| `levelOfAssurance` | The [level of assurance][loa] for your service                |

All fields are mandatory.

### Handle the translated response from the VSP

An `HTTP 200 OK` response confirms the VSP translated the SAML response successfully. The response body contains:

```http
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Content-Type: application/json
>
{
    "scenario": "AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE"
}
```

When the translated SAML response contains the `AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE` scenario, your service should redirect the user to a page offering them other ways to use your service. This could be another way of proving their identity online or going somewhere in person to finish the process.


## Next steps

After implementing all scenarios, your service should be able to handle all possible responses from GOV.UK Verify Hub:

- `IDENTITY_VERIFIED`
- `NO_AUTHENTICATION`
- `AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE`

If your need to link the identity dataset received with user information your service already has, refer to the section on [handling the identity dataset][handle-identity-dataset].
