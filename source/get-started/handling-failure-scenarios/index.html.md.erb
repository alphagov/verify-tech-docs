# Handling failure scenarios

By default, the GOV.UK Verify Hub handles the 2 following possible failure scenarios:

- if an identity provider cannot verify the user's identity, the GOV.UK Verify Hub redirects the user to an [error page][error-page-not-verified]
- if the session ends before the user completes the journey, the GOV.UK Verify Hub redirects the user to a page containing a link back to your service start page

If your service needs to handle these scenarios in a different way, you must [request to be sent failure responses][support] from the GOV.UK Verify Hub. 
Failure responses tell your service which failure scenario your user has encountered, and allow you to customise your user journey.

## Before you start customising

To follow instructions on this page, you must have already:

- downloaded [the latest VSP release][vsp-release] from GitHub
- familiarised yourself with or implemented [the successful verification scenario][successful-verification]

The guide uses a GOV.UK Verify-hosted testing service as a placeholder for the GOV.UK Verify Hub.
This means you can follow the instructions on this page using your local VSP setup, without any additional backing services.

This guide continues from the ['Response from the testing service' section][response-from-testing-service].

## Failure scenario responses

There are 2 scenarios when the user does not successfully complete the verification journey.

If the identity provider cannot verify the user's identity, GOV.UK Verify Hub sends an `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` response.

If the session ends before the user completes the verification journey, GOV.UK Verify Hub sends a `NO_AUTHENTICATION` response.

Your service will only receive failure responses from the GOV.UK Verify Hub if you have requested these responses.

## Run the scenario

1. Submit [an authentication request to the testing service][send-request].
2. Go to the `responseGeneratorLocation` URL in the [response from the testing service][scenario-list].
3. Select the `executeUri` for the `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` or `NO_AUTHENTICATION`  scenario.

This is an example of a `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` JSON object:

```json
{
  "executeUri" : "https://compliance-tool-reference.ida.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk:443/rp-test/_6817b389-4924-479c-9851-db089c4e639c/test-non-matching/10",
  "id" : 14,
  "title" : "AUTHENTICATION_FAILED",
  "description" : "The identity provider could not verify the user's identity."
},
```

This is an example of a `NO_AUTHENTICATION` JSON object:

```json
{
  "executeUri" : "https://compliance-tool-reference.ida.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk:443/rp-test/_6817b389-4924-479c-9851-db089c4e639c/test-non-matching/10",
  "id" : 12,
  "title" : "NO_AUTHENTICATION",
  "description" : "The session ended before the user completed the verification journey."
},
```

The `responseGeneratorLocation` and `executeUri` are only valid for the VSP session that generated them. The VSP generates a new set of keys for the testing service every time you start the VSP with the development command, which leads to the URLs changing.

If the `responseGeneratorLocation` or `executeUri` you generated do not work, restart your VSP. The GOV.UK Verify team occasionally restarts the testing service, which clears the current testing session. Restarting your VSP restores the connection with the testing service.

## Receive the SAML response from the testing service

Visiting the `executeUri` for the `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` or `NO_AUTHENTICATION`  scenario causes the testing service to generate a SAML response for that scenario.

The testing service sends the SAML response inside an HTML form, through the browser. The SAML response is base64 encoded within the `SAMLResponse` form parameter:

```
...
SAMLResponse=PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiPz4KPHNhbWwycDpSZXNwb25zZSBEZXN0aW5hdGlvbj0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYXNzcG9ydC12ZXJpZnktc3R1Yi1yZWx5aW5nLXBhcnR5LWRldi5jbG91ZGFwcHMuZGlnaXRhbC92ZXJpZnkv...
...
```

Your service receives the form at the endpoint provided when starting the VSP.

The testing service generates these responses. To get the failure responses from the GOV.UK Verify Hub in the Integration or Production environments, you must [contact the GOV.UK Verify team][support].

## Request to translate the SAML response

To translate the SAML response into JSON, make an HTTP POST request to the VSP's `/translate-response` endpoint:

```http
> POST /translate-response HTTP/1.1
> Content-Type: application/json
>
{
  "samlResponse" : "PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiPz48c2FtbDJwOkF1dGhuUmVxdWVzdCB4bWxuczpzYW1sMnA9InVybjpvYXNpczpuYW1lczp0YzpTQU1MOjIuMDpwcm90b2NvbCIgRGVzdGluYXRpb249Imh0dHBzOi8vY29tc...",
  "requestId" : "_64c90b35-154f-4e9f-a75b-3a58a6c55e8b",
  "levelOfAssurance" : "LEVEL_2"
}
```

The fields in the request body are:

| Field          | Description                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `samlResponse`     | Base64 encoded SAML response from the testing service                  |
| `requestId`        | The string you saved when generating the authentication request |
| `levelOfAssurance` | The [level of assurance][loa] for your service |

## Handle the translated response from the VSP

An `HTTP 200 OK` response confirms the VSP translated the SAML response successfully.

The response body for a `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` scenario contains:

```http
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Content-Type: application/json
>
{
    "scenario": "AUTHENTICATION_FAILED"
}
```

The response body for a `NO_AUTHENTICATION` scenario contains:

```http
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Content-Type: application/json
>
{
    "scenario": "NO_AUTHENTICATION"
}
```

When the translated SAML response contains the `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` or `NO_AUTHENTICATION` scenario, your service should send the user to the next page in your service journey.
