# Matching Service Adapter encryption

If your connection to GOV.UK Verify involves a Matching Service Adapter (MSA), you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

You must update the certificates containing your MSA's public keys before they expire. If you do not, your users will not be able to access your service using GOV.UK Verify.

## Rotate your MSA encryption key and certificate

### Step 1. Create a new self-signed encryption certificate

  <%= partial "partials/get-self-signed-certificates", locals: locals %>

### Step 2. Add the new encryption key and certificate to your MSA configuration

  <%= partial "partials/add-new-key", locals: locals %>

### Step 3. Upload the new encryption certificate

  <%= partial "partials/upload-new-certificate", locals: locals %>

### Step 4. Delete the old MSA encryption key and certificate

  <%= partial "partials/remove-old-key", locals: locals %>
