# Service provider signing

If you built your own service provider to connect to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

If you're using the Verify Service Provider, [see how to update your Verify Service Provider keys][rotate-vsp-encryption].

## Rotate your service provider signing key and certificate

### Step 1. Create a new self-signed signing certificate

  <%= partial "partials/get-self-signed-certificates", locals: locals %>

### Step 2. Upload the new signing certificate

  <%= partial "partials/upload-new-certificate", locals: locals %>

### Step 3. Replace the old signing key

  <%= partial "partials/replace-old-key", locals: locals %>

### Step 4. Remove your old certificate from the GOV.UK Verify Hub configuration

  <%= partial "partials/remove-old-certificate", locals: locals %>
