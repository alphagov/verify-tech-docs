# Verify Service Provider encryption

If you're using the Verify Service Provider (VSP) to connect to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

If you're using a custom service provider, [go to the section about updating service provider keys][rotate-sp-encryption].

## Rotate your VSP encryption key and certificate

### Step 1. Create a new self-signed encryption certificate

  <%= partial "partials/add-new-key", locals: locals %>

### Step 3: Upload the new encryption certificate

  <%= partial "partials/upload-new-certificate", locals: locals %>
