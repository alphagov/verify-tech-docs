# Verify Service Provider encryption

If you're using the Verify Service Provider (VSP) to connect to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

If you're using a custom service provider, [see how to update your service provider keys][rotate-sp-encryption].

## Rotate your VSP encryption key and certificate

### Step 1. Create a new self-signed encryption certificate

  <%= partial "partials/get-self-signed-certificates", locals: locals %>

### Step 2. Add the new encryption key to the VSP configuration

  <%= partial "partials/add-new-key", locals: locals %>

### Step 3: Upload the new encryption certificate

  <%= partial "partials/upload-new-certificate", locals: locals %>

### Step 4. Remove the old encryption key

  <%= partial "partials/remove-old-key", locals: locals %>
