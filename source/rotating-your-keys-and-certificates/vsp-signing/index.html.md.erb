# Verify Service Provider signing

If you're using the Verify Service Provider (VSP) to connect to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

If you're using a custom service provider, [see how to update your service provider keys][rotate-sp-signing].

## Rotate your VSP signing key and certificate

### Step 1. Create a new self-signed signing certificate

  <%= partial "partials/get-self-signed-certificates", locals: locals %>

### Step 2. Upload the new signing certificate

  <%= partial "partials/upload-new-certificate", locals: locals %>

### Step 3. Replace the old signing key

  <%= partial "partials/replace-old-key", locals: locals %>

### Step 4. Remove your old certificate from the GOV.UK Verify Hub configuration

  <%= partial "partials/remove-old-certificate", locals: locals %>
