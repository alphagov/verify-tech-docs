# Matching Service Adapter signing

If your connection to GOV.UK Verify involves a Matching Service Adapter (MSA), you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

You must update the certificates containing your MSA's public keys before they expire. If you do not, your users will not be able to access your service using GOV.UK Verify.

## Rotate your MSA signing key and certificate

### Step 1. Create a new self-signed signing certificate

  <%= partial "partials/get-self-signed-certificates", locals: locals %>

### Step 2. Add the new signing key and certificate to your MSA configuration

  <%= partial "partials/add-new-key", locals: locals %>

### Step 3. Upload the new signing certificate

  <%= partial "partials/upload-new-certificate", locals: locals %>

### Step 4. Delete the old MSA signing key and certificate

  <%= partial "partials/remove-old-key", locals: locals %>

### Step 5. Remove your old certificate from the GOV.UK Verify Hub configuration

  <%= partial "partials/remove-old-certificate", locals: locals %>
