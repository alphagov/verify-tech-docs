# Service provider without dual running

If you built your own service provider to connect to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

Because your service provider does not support dual running for your encryption keys, there will be a small outage when you update the encryption key. To minimise disruption to your users, it's recommended you do the update during periods of low traffic for your service.

If you're using the Verify Service Provider, [see how to update your Verify Service Provider keys][rotate-vsp-encryption].

## Rotate your service provider encryption key and certificate

### Step 1. Create a new self-signed encryption certificate

  <%= partial "partials/get-self-signed-certificates", locals: locals %>

### Step 2. Upload the new encryption certificate

  <%= partial "partials/upload-new-certificate", locals: locals %>

### Step 3. Replace the old encryption key

  <%= partial "partials/restore-connection", locals: locals %>
