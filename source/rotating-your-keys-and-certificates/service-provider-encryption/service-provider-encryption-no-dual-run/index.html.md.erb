# Service provider without dual running

If you built your own service provider to connect to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

Because your service provider does not support dual running for your encryption keys, there will be a small outage when you update the encryption key. To minimise disruption to your users, it's recommended you do the update during periods of low traffic for your service.

If you're using the Verify Service Provider, [see how to update your Verify Service Provider keys][vsp-keys].

## Replace your service provider encryption key and certificate

### Step 1. Create a new self-signed encryption certificate

<%= partial("partials/get-self-signed-certificates") %>

### Step 2. Upload the new encryption certificate

Upload your new encryption certificate to the GOV.UK Verify Manage certificates service.

This starts a deployment process to replace your old service provider encryption certificate with the new one in the GOV.UK Verify Hub configuration.
When the deployment is complete, the GOV.UK Verify Hub will be using your new certificate to encrypt messages for your service.

<%= warning_text('Your connection to GOV.UK Verify will break once your new encryption certificate is deployed to the GOV.UK Verify Hub. Restore your connection in the next step.') %>

The deployment process takes approximately 10 minutes. You will receive e-mail confirmation when the GOV.UK Verify Hub starts using your new encryption certificate. You can also check the deployment status on the [GOV.UK Verify Manage certificates service dashboard][dashboard].

### Step 3. Replace the old encryption key

Replace your old service provider private encryption key with the new one.

Your connection to GOV.UK Verify is restored once your new service provider encryption key is live.

Once your new encryption key is live, your service provider will be using it to decrypt messages from GOV.UK Verify Hub.
