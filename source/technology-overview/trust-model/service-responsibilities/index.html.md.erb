# Service team responsibilities

GOV.UK Verify uses encryption and signing to secure message exchange.

As a service connected to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for

- reading the policy documentation
- keeping signing and encryption certificates up to date

## Keep your certificates up to date

The [Verify Service Provider (VSP)][vsp-intro] handles encryption and signing for your service. You generate your first set of VSP encryption and signing keys and certificates when you first connect to the [Integration][get-cert-test] or [Production][get-cert-prod] environments.

Once connected, you must keep your VSP encryption and signing certificates up to date for all environments you're connected to.

If a VSP certificate expires while in use, your connection to that GOV.UK Verify environment breaks. For the Production environment, this means your users won’t be able to access your service using GOV.UK Verify.

When a certificate is due to expire, you must renew it by following the corresponding key rotation process. For example, find out how to rotate your:

- [VSP encryption key][rotate-vsp-encryption]
- [VSP signing key][rotate-vsp-signing]

Services that started connecting to GOV.UK Verify before January 2019 are also responsible for keeping Matching Service Adapter certificates up to date. If you are running a custom service provider instead of the VSP, you must keep the service provider's certificates up to date.
