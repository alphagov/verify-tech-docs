# Update your service provider signing key and certificate

If you built your own service provider to connect to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

If you're using the Verify Service Provider, [see how to update your Verify Service Provider keys][vsp-keys].

## Step 1. Get a new self-signed signing certificate

<%= partial("partials/get-self-signed-certificates") %>

## Step 2. Upload the new signing certificate

Upload your new signing certificate to the [GOV.UK Verify Service Admin tool][manage-certs].

You will get an e-mail confirmation when the GOV.UK Verify team have deployed your new signing certificate. Wait for this confirmation before moving to the next step.

## Step 3. Replace the old signing key pair

Replace the old private signing key with the new key on your service endpoint - your service provider now signs SAML messages with the new key.

You don't need to let the GOV.UK Verify team know that the new key is live. GOV.UK Verify Hub will continue to trust the your old certificate for a week from the time you uploaded your new one or until the expiry date, whichever is closer.

The GOV.UK Verify hub now trusts SAML messages signed with your new service provider signing key.
