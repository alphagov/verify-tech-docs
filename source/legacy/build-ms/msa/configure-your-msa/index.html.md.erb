# Configure your MSA


Below is the `test-config.yml` file:

```yaml
# Configure the matching service adapter's server settings here.
server:
  # Ports on which to listen for normal connections.
  # See http://www.dropwizard.io for information on HTTPS and TLS connections.
  applicationConnectors:
    - type: http
      port: 8080
  # Ports on which to listen for admin tasks.
  # This can probably be set to the above port+1.
  adminConnectors:
    - type: http
      port: 8081

# Add information about your matching service adapter (MSA) here.
matchingServiceAdapter:
  # The entityId is used for SAML communication with Verify.
  entityId: my-entity-id
  # The externalUrl is the internet-facing URL for your MSA.
  externalUrl: http://service.gov.uk/matching-service/POST

# Configure the URLs for your local matching service here.
localMatchingService:
  # The matchUrl is where the MSA should post user attributes on a successful match
  matchUrl: http://service.gov.uk/local-matching/match
  # The accountCreationUrl is where the MSA should post attributes for unknown users
  accountCreationUrl: http://service.gov.uk/local-matching/create-account

# Configure the key pairs used by your MSA for signing SAML messages here.
signingKeys:
  # The primary signing key is used to sign all messages to Verify.
  primary:
    publicKey:
      # The certificate (.crt) containing the primary public signing key:
      certFile: test_primary_signing.crt
      # The common name (CN) of that certificate:
      name: Test MSA Signing
    privateKey:
      # The PK8 (.pk8) containing the primary private signing key:
      keyFile: test_primary_signing.pk8
  # The public part of the secondary signing key is published in the MSA's metadata
  # during key rollovers but is otherwise unused by the MSA.
  secondary:
    publicKey:
      certFile: test_secondary_signing.crt
      name: Test Another MSA Signing
    privateKey:
      keyFile: test_secondary_signing.pk8

# Configure the key pairs used by your MSA for encrypting and decrypting SAML
# messages here. You can configure up to 2 encryption keys at a time and the MSA
# will attempt decryption with both. Only the first key will be used for encryption.
encryptionKeys:
  - publicKey:
      certFile: test_msa_encryption_1.crt
      name: Test MSA Encryption 1
    privateKey:
      keyFile: test_msa_encryption_1.pk8
  - publicKey:
      certFile: test_msa_encryption_2.crt
      name: Test MSA Encryption 2
    privateKey:
      keyFile: test_msa_encryption_2.pk8

# Settings for connecting with the hub can be configured here
# if necessary.
hub:
  ssoUrl: https://compliance-tool-reference.ida.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/SAML2/SSO

# Settings for obtaining Verify's metadata can be configured here.
metadata:
  environment: INTEGRATION
  url: https://compliance-tool-reference.ida.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/federation
  trustStore:
    path: test_ida_metadata.ts
    password: puppet
# To override the `hub` and `idp` trust stores, i.e. for testing or manual modifications,
# you can extract them from the MSA JAR file to a local disk, modify them, and then un-comment the following section:
  # hubTrustStore:
    # path: test_hub.ts
    # password: puppet
  # idpTrustStore:
    # path: test_idp.ts
    # password: puppet

# This is a required section if your service needs to consume European identities.
europeanIdentity:
  enabled: ${EUROPEAN_IDENTITY_ENABLED} # true or false
  hubConnectorEntityId: https://www.integration.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/connector # The URL of the metadata for the node that requests and receives identities from European countries.
  # Configure metadata for European countries.
  aggregatedMetadata:
    trustAnchorUri: https://www.integration.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/trust-anchor # The location of the trust anchor used to validate country metadata
    metadataSourceUri: https://www.integration.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/aggregator # The location of the aggregated country metadata
    trustStore: # The location and password for the truststore
      path: test_ida_metadata.ts
      password: puppet

## Options to add additional logging. By default, logs will be output to console.
## See http://www.dropwizard.io for more information.
#logging:
#  level: INFO
#  appenders:
#    - type: file
#      currentLogFilename: apps-home/test-rp-msa.log
#      archivedLogFilenamePattern: apps-home/test-rp-msa.log.%d.gz
#      logFormat: '%-5p [%d{ISO8601,UTC}] %c: %X{logPrefix}%m%n%xEx'
#    - type: console
#      logFormat: '%-5p [%d{ISO8601,UTC}] %c: %X{logPrefix}%m%n%xEx'
#
#
## By default the MSA signs messages using SHA-256.
## Switch the flag below to `true` if you need to revert to SHA-1 signing:
#shouldSignWithSHA1: false
```

## Adapt your configuration file

Make the following changes to the YAML configuration file according to the environment where you want to use the MSA. Variations are indicated for the SAML compliance tool and integration and production environments.

### `server`

Enter port numbers for the server application (`applicationConnectors`) and admin ports (`adminConnectors`).

If the MSA will be handling SSL termination (typically this will be handled by a proxy or load balancer like HAProxy), or if you don't trust the network between the SSL termination endpoint and the MSA, then specify `https` rather than `http` for the type of connection. For more information, see the guidance in the [DropWizard configuration manual](http://dropwizard.github.io/).

### `matchingServiceAdapter`

Enter the entityID for the MSA in `entityId`. This should reflect the name of your service, for example `https://<service name>/MSA`. It's good practice to use the MSA's URI (where the hub will send matching requests) as its entityID, but this isn't mandatory.

Enter the URI for your MSA in `externalUrl`.

### `localMatchingService`

Enter the URI for your local matching service in `matchUrl`.

If you're creating new user accounts when a match isn't found (see [create new user accounts](LINK)), enter the user account creation URI in `accountCreationUrl`.

### `signingKeys`

Enter the paths of the primary SAML signing keys and certificates for your MSA in `primary`.

For the compliance tool, [generate self-signed certificates](LINK).

You'll use different keys and certificates for the integration and production environments - see [pkiRequestCert](LINK).

To convert a private key to PKCS#8 DER format, run the following command:

```
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in server.key -out server.pk8 -outform DER
```

### `encryptionKeys`

Enter the paths and names of the encryption keys and certificates for your MSA in `encryptionKeys`.  The names are used to identify the certificates in the metadata so should be meaningful and unique, for example, `signing_1` and `encryption_1`.

### `metadata`

Edit the `url` value and specify the location where the MSA accesses the SAML metadata:

  * for the SAML compliance tool, use the default setting in the `test-config.yml` file

  * for the integration environment, enter: `https://www.integration.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/federation` in the `test-config.yml` file

  * for the production environment, use the default setting in the `prod-config.yml` file

In `trustStore.path`, specify the path to your metadata truststore file for the appropriate environment:

  * for the SAML compliance tool and the integration environment, use the provided `test_ida_metadata.ts` file (this is the default setting in the `test-config.yml` file)

  * for the production environment, use the provided `prod_ida_metadata.ts` file (this is the default setting in the `prod-config.yml` file)

Optionally, if you need to override the `hub` and `idp` truststore path for testing in Integration, uncomment the `hubTrustStore` and `idpTrustStore` sections in `test-config.yml`.

### `europeanIdentity`

Configure according to the needs of your service.

If your service needs to consume European identities, set `enabled: true`.
You also need to configure the URLs for the environments you want to use, for example integration or production. Enabling your service to consume European identities also implies that it will be using [the universal JSON matching schema](LINK). The schema will apply to datasets from both European countries, as well as GOV.UK Verify identity providers.

If if you need to disable European identities, set `enabled: false` in this section. This setting also implies your MSA will be using [the legacy JSON matching schema](LINK).
