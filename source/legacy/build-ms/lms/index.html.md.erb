# Local Matching Service

A Local Matching Service helps you to find a match between a user’s verified identity and a record in your existing database(s). You must build your own Local Matching Service and host it on your own infrastructure.

As well as following this guidance, you can refer to the [example Local Matching Service built by the GOV.UK Verify team](LINK). It uses a [simplified version of a matching strategy from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP)](LINK).

You can also use a [matching service test tool built by the GOV.UK Verify team](LINK) to make sure your Local Matching Service can:

- handle matching datasets
- find and match records correctly
- handle matching failures
