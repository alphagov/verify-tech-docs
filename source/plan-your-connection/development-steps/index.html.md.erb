# Development steps

Before starting the development phase, you should have already decided:

- which [service provider](LINK) option you are implementing
- how to [store and manage your encryption and signing keys](LINK)

## Local development phase

In this phase, you are setting up and testing your service provider. You can do all all of this on a development machine.

After successfully testing your service provider, you can move on to deploying and testing in the Integration environment.

### Set up your service provider

1. [Send an authentication request to the GOV.UK Verify hub](LINK).
1. [Handle the SAML response from the GOV.UK Verify hub](LINK) .

Outcome: you’re ready to run SAML compliance tests.

For more information, see [How SAML works with GOV.UK Verify](LINK) and the [Identity Assurance Hub Service SAML 2.0 Profile](LINK).

### Test your service provider

You should [use the Compliance Tool to test] that your service provider handles all the required scenarios correctly.

Outcome: your service and matching service can consume and produce valid SAML.

For more information, see [How SAML works with GOV.UK Verify](LINK).

## Development in the Integration environment

### Request access to the Integration environment.


1. [Obtain signed certificates](LINK) for the Integration environment from the IDAP test certificate authority
1. [Fill in the ‘Request access to an environment‘ form](LINK)

Outcome: you’re ready to connect your service to the Integration environment.

For more information, see [GOV.UK Verify environments](LINK) and [How a PKI works](LINK).

### Connect your service provider to the Integration environment

To do this:

1. [Download the VSP](LINK).
2. [Configure the VSP for the Integration environment](LINK).

Outcome: you’re ready to run end-to-end testing with test users.

For more information, see [Install and configure the Matching Service Adapter](LINK) and [GOV.UK Verify environments](LINK).

### Run end-to-end testing of all your user journeys in the Integration environment.

To do this:

1. Set up authentication to manage test users.
1. Create test users.
1. Run end-to-end tests.

Outcome: your service can handle all the possible outcomes of end-to-end user journeys.

For more information, see [GOV.UK Verify environments](LINK).

## Connect to Production and go live

Once

### Request access to the production environment.

To do this:

1. Obtain [signed certificates](LINK) for the production environment from the IDAP certificate authority.
1. [Fill in the ‘Request access to an environment‘ form](LINK).

Outcome: you’re ready to connect your service provider to the Production environment.

For more information, see [GOV.UK Verify environments](LINK) and [How a PKI works](LINK).

## Maintenance

### Rotate your keys.

When the certificates containing your public keys are due to expire, [replace your keys and certificates](LINK).

Outcome: the encryption and signing certificates for your service and Matching Service Adapter are up to date.

For more information, see [How a PKI works](LINK).
