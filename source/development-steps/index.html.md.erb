# Development steps

This is a summary of the technical steps involved in connecting your service to GOV.UK Verify. This summary will help set a roadmap for your team's development work.

Before starting development, you should have already decided how to:

- [use the data you get from the GOV.UK Verify Hub][decide-data]
- [store and manage your encryption and signing keys][pki].

## Local development

In this phase, you're setting up the Verify Service Provider to generate  authentication requests and translate responses.

Make sure your service correctly uses the Verify Service Provider to handle:

- [successful verification responses][successful-verification]
- customised [failure scenarios][vsp-guide-failure], if your service requires this

You should also test that your service can handle [your use case for data from the GOV.UK Verify Hub][decide-data].

For a detailed description of the Verify Service Provider's API, see:

- the [API reference documentation][vsp-api]
- the [OpenAPI v3 description][vsp-openapi3]

## End-to-end testing

In this phase, you're doing end-to-end testing of user journeys in a secure test environment. The environment known as 'Integration' contains a full-scale deployment of the GOV.UK Verify Hub.

To access the test environment:

1. [Generate self-signed certificates][get-first-certs-test] for the test environment.
1. [Fill in the 'Request access to an environment' form][env-request-form].
1. [Configure the VSP][vsp-config-readme] for the test environment.

Once connected to the test environment, [run end-to-end testing][test-in-integration] on all your user journeys.

## Go live

To access the production environment:

1. [Generate self-signed certificates][get-first-certs-prod] for the production environment.
1. [Fill in the 'Request access to an environment' form][env-request-form].
1. [Configure the VSP][vsp-config-readme] for the production environment.

You’re ready to connect your Verify Service Provider to the production environment.

## Maintenance

To keep your service connected to the GOV.UK Verify Hub, your certificates must be up to date. Make sure you [update your certificates][rotate-keys] when they are due to expire.

Make sure you're running an up-to-date [release of the Verify Service Provider][vsp-release].
