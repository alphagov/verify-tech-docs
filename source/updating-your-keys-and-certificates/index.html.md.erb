# Updating your keys and certificates

When the certificates containing your public keys are due to expire, you must update them. If you don't, your users won't be able to access your service using GOV.UK Verify.

As a government service you are responsible for maintaining the encryption and signing keys and certificates for your service provider and Matching Service Adapter (MSA), if you are running one. Your service provider could be the [Verify Service Provider (VSP)][vsp-github] or another service provider.
