# Update your Matching Service Adapter encryption key and certificate

If your connection to GOV.UK Verify involves a Matching Service Adapter (MSA), you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

You must update the certificates containing your MSA's public keys before they expire. If you don't, your users wont be able to access your service using GOV.UK Verify.

## Update your Matching Service Adapter encryption key and certificate

### Step 1. Get a new self-signed encryption certificate

<%= partial("partials/get-self-signed-certificates") %>

### Step 2. Add the new encryption key pair to your MSA configuration

Add a second list item containing the details for your new key and self-signed certificate under `encryptionKeys` in your [MSA configuration][msa-config], for example:

```yaml
encryptionKeys:
- publicKey:
    certFile: msa_encryption_2016.crt
    name: MSA Encryption 2016
  privateKey:
    keyFile: msa_encryption_2016.pk8
- publicKey:
    certFile: msa_encryption_2017.crt
    name: MSA Encryption 2017
  privateKey:
    keyFile: msa_encryption_2017.pk8
```

Restart the MSA to implement the configuration changes. The MSA can now use both the new and old keys to decrypt SAML messages.

### Step 3. Upload the new encryption certificate

To make GOV.UK Verify Hub use your new encryption self-signed certificate, upload it to the GOV.UK Verify Service Admin tool.

Uploading your new certificate causes a configuration change for GOV.UK Verify Hub.

You will receive e-mail confirmation when thee deployment of your new certificate is complete. Wait for this confirmation before moving to the next step.

### Step 4. Delete the old encryption key pair

Delete the old encryption key and certificate.

Restart the MSA to implement the configuration changes.

The MSA now uses the new encryption key to decrypt SAML messages, and the GOV.UK Verify hub now uses your new self-signed encryption certificate to encrypt SAML messages for your service.

> While both old and new keys are in use, you may see error messages in the logs with the description `Unwrapping failed`. These messages appear because the MSA attempts to decrypt the SAML message using each key in turn. You can safely ignore these messages. However, do not ignore any other error messages related to SAML decryption.
