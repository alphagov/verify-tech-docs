To make sure the GOV.UK Verify Hub does not trust messages signed with your old  key, you must also remove your old certificate from the GOV.UK Verify Hub configuration.

1. Go to the [GOV.UK Verify Manage certificates service dashboard][dashboard].
1. Select the <%= component %> <%= type %> certificate due to expire.
1. Select **Stop using this certificate**.

The GOV.UK Verify Hub now only trusts messages signed with your new <%= component %> <%= type %> key.
