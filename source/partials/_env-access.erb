# Get environment access

An environment is a fully-working deployment of the GOV.UK Verify hub. GOV.UK Verify maintains a number of environments for development, testing, and operational purposes. As a government service you need to work in the Integration and Production environments.

GOV.UK Verify provides two identical, secure environments:

- Integration
- Production

<% if env == "Integration" %>
Integration allows you to test your prototype service with dummy user data.
<% end %>

<% if env == "Production" %>
Production allows you to host your fully-developed beta or live service with real user data. The production environment is where you deploy your live end-to-end service. It's a restricted environment for security reasons.
<% end %>

You must complete a short form with information about your service so GOV.UK Verify can set up each environment for you. This can take up to 5 working days.

You’ll need to submit a form for each environment you need.

[Submit form.](https://verify-environment-access.cloudapps.digital/)

## Before you start

The form does not store data between sessions. You must make sure you have all the information available to submit the form within a single session.

To complete the form you’ll need to share URLs for your:

- Verify Service Provider
- service start point or page
- [Verify SAML response][verify-saml-response]

You’ll need to provide web content to personalise the Verify Hub for your end users, including:

- your agency or department name (as you need it to appear to the user)
- a display name for your Verify service (as you need it to appear to the user)
- contact details for your service
- a description of other ways users can access your service

You’ll need to provide [valid, signed IDAP X.509 Public certificates][get-cert-test] for:

- Verify Service Provider signature validation
- Verify Service Provider encryption

For <%= env %> environments, you’ll also need to provide a username and password to manage the test user data.
