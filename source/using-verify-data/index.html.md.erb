# Decide how to use data from GOV.UK Verify

When an identity provider successfully verifies a userâ€™s identity, the response from the GOV.UK Verify Hub will contain information about that user.

Your use case for this information depends on your service's needs. You might need to:

- link the user information with user data your service already holds
- store the information as part of an audit requirement
- forward it to a case worker
- use the information to create new records

<%= warning_text('You must clearly explain to your users why you are collecting the data and what it will be used for.') %>

Your service might not need to handle information about users at all. Identity confirmation might be enough for your users to access your service.
