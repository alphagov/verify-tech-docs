# Set up service provider

The first step in connecting to GOV.UK Verify is setting up a service provider locally.

The service provider allows you to send SAML messages to the Verify Hub and receive SAML responses in return.

The service provider allows you to send and receive messages from the GOV.UK Verify hub.

To set up the VSP locally, you should configure it and make sure it can correctly send and receive messages from the GOV.UK Verify Hub in all the [required scenarios][scenarios].

You can test your VSP works properly using the Compliance Tool.

The GOV.UK Verify team will ask about Compliance Tool testing results ahead of connecting to the Integration environment.

## VSP

Your service must use a system to send  This system is known as a Service Provider.

You can either:

- use the Service Provider built by Verify, known as the [Verify Service Provider](https://github.com/alphagov/verify-service-provider) (recommended)
- configure an off-the-shelf product to use as a Service Provider
- build your own Service Provider

Whichever option you choose, you must [run compliance tests](LINK) to check you can send and receive SAML messages successfully in all possible scenarios.

If you're thinking of building your own service provider, you should contact the GOV.UK Verify team before starting any development work.
