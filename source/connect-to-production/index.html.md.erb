# Connect to Production

The Production environment is where you deploy your live end-to-end service. It’s a restricted environment for security reasons.

You can connect to the Production environment once your service can handle all the possible outcomes of end-to-end user journeys.

## What do you need to do?

To access the integration environment:

1. Obtain [signed certificates](LINK) for the Production environment from the certificate authority.

2. Provide additional details of your service in the '[Request access to an environment](LINK)' form.
